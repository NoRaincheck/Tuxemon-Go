# Tuxemon-Go

This repository is a learning project focused on game development using Go. The goal is to recreate or port existing games to understand core game development concepts.

Tuxemon was selected as the reference game because it provides complete assets and familiar gameplay mechanics, while offering a constrained environment that helps focus on fundamental game development principles.

The project aims to create a portable implementation that can generate cross-platform binaries for easy distribution and play.
