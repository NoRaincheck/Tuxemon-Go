# Tuxemon-Go

This repository is a learning project focused on game development using Go. The goal is to recreate or port existing games to understand core game development concepts.

[Tuxemon](https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon) was selected as the reference game because it provides complete assets and familiar gameplay mechanics, while offering a constrained environment that helps focus on fundamental game development principles.

The project aims to create a portable implementation that can generate cross-platform binaries for easy distribution and play.
